#An oportunity to reflect on professionalism...


From this project, I attained mastery of HTML basics. This encompasses the creation of exceptional lists - ordered, unordered, and description lists. 

Complementing to that, this project has pioneered my adventure to advanced mobile web app development; which was proven by the superb use of the image (img) element and its contemporary attributes that are irreplaceable in professional projects that needs to be shipped with agile and lean assurance - meeting the demands of any caliber of client/customer(s).

The anchor tag (a) was eqaully put to quality use in this unprecedented project that displays professionalism from day one!

Finally, I learned a lot from styling this project, on cascades and specificity, to be specific. Though the styles are minimal, but it is a true example of achieving extraordinary results in an ordinary way!
  
I would be glad to hear your thoughts - any suggestion(s) and/or corrections will be highly appreciated. 

Thank you!
